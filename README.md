A daemon-based synchronization tool for uploading media files from a Linux desktop to an [Immich](https://immich.app/) server.

Mimick monitors local directories (e.g., `~/Pictures`, `~/Videos`) for new files and automatically uploads them to your Immich instance. It runs securely as a background service and integrates natively with the GNOME desktop environment via a GTK4 / Libadwaita settings window and a StatusNotifier system tray icon.

> [!NOTE]
> **This project is in BETA.** Core features are stable and tested. Please report any issues or edge cases you encounter.

**Status:** Beta. Supports Immich v1.118+.

## Features

- **File Monitoring**: Watches selected folders for new files and waits for stable size before uploading.
- **SHA-1 Checksumming**: Deduplication via checksum before upload — exact same logic as the Immich mobile apps.
- **Concurrent Uploads**: 10 parallel worker tasks stream files directly from disk, keeping RAM usage constant.
- **Offline Reliability**: Failed uploads are persisted to `~/.cache/mimick/retries.json` and replayed automatically on next launch.
- **Connectivity**: Automatically switches between **Internal (LAN)** and **External (WAN)** URLs based on availability. At least one must be enabled (enforced by the UI).
- **Custom Album Mapping**: Select an existing remote album, type a custom name, or let the app create an album from the local folder name (e.g., `~/Pictures/Vacation 2024` → Album `Vacation 2024`).
- **One-Way Sync**: Uploads media without modifying local files.
- **Security**: API Key stored in the system keyring via `secret-tool` (libsecret).
- **Autostart**: Optional login startup with desktop-portal permission inside Flatpak and native autostart integration outside Flatpak.
- **Clear Window Controls**: `Close` hides the settings window, while `Quit` stops the app completely.
- **Desktop Integration**:
  - GTK4 / Libadwaita settings UI (dark mode by default).
  - StatusNotifierItem system tray icon (requires AppIndicator support on GNOME).

## Installation (Recommended)

The easiest and official way to install Mimick on any Linux distribution is via our Flatpak repository. This ensures you receive automatic updates whenever a new version is released.

Run these commands in your terminal:


# 1. Add the official Mimick repository

```bash
flatpak remote-add --user --if-not-exists mimick-repo [https://nicx17.github.io/mimick/mimick.flatpakrepo](https://nicx17.github.io/mimick/mimick.flatpakrepo)
```

# 2. Install the application

```bash
flatpak install --user mimick-repo io.github.nicx17.mimick
```
---

## Usage & Configuration

### First Launch

Launch Mimick from your Application Launcher. The settings window opens automatically on first launch.

1. **Internal URL** — LAN address (e.g., `http://192.168.1.50:2283`).
2. **External URL** — WAN/Public address (e.g., `https://photos.example.com`). *At least one must be enabled.*
3. **API Key** — Generate in Immich Web UI under Account Settings > API Keys. Needs **Asset** and **Album** read/create permissions.
4. **Watch Paths** — Add folders to monitor with the built-in folder picker. Each folder can be assigned a target Immich album.
5. **Run on Startup** — Enable this in the **Behavior** section to start Mimick automatically when you log in.
6. **Save & Restart** — Applies your settings and relaunches Mimick automatically.
7. **Close / Quit** — `Close` hides the settings window and leaves Mimick running; `Quit` fully exits the app.

### Autostart

Use the built-in **Run on Startup** switch in the settings window.

* Flatpak builds request background/autostart permission through the desktop portal.
* Native builds write an autostart desktop entry to `~/.config/autostart/io.github.nicx17.mimick.desktop`.

### Folder Access

Mimick now uses selected-folder access instead of full home-directory access in Flatpak.

* Add watch folders from the settings window so the file chooser portal can grant access.
* If you are upgrading from an older build that had full home access, re-add your existing watch folders once so the new permission model can take effect.
* Portal-backed folders may appear by name in the UI and logs instead of showing the raw `/run/user/.../doc/...` sandbox path.

### Quitting vs Closing

Mimick is a background app, so closing the settings window does not quit it.

* Use **Close** in the settings window or the window close button to hide the window and keep Mimick running in the tray.
* Use **Quit** from the tray menu, the settings window, or the launcher action to stop the app completely.

## Building from Source (For Developers)

If you prefer to compile Mimick yourself, you can build it natively or package it as a local Flatpak.

### Prerequisites (Native Build)

* Rust toolchain (`cargo`): https://rustup.rs
* GTK4 + Libadwaita development headers

**Ubuntu / Debian:**

```bash
sudo apt install libgtk-4-dev libadwaita-1-dev libglib2.0-dev pkg-config build-essential libsecret-1-dev

```

**Fedora:**

```bash
sudo dnf install gtk4-devel libadwaita-devel libsecret-devel pkg-config

```

**Arch Linux:**

```bash
sudo pacman -S gtk4 libadwaita libsecret pkgconf base-devel

```

### Native Rust Build

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/nicx17/mimick.git](https://github.com/nicx17/mimick.git)
cd mimick
cargo build --release
# Copy the desktop file and icons from setup/ to ~/.local/share/applications and ~/.local/share/icons for launcher integration

# Run Directly
cargo run                   # start in background mode
cargo run -- --settings     # open the settings window immediately

```

### Local Flatpak Build

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/nicx17/mimick.git](https://github.com/nicx17/mimick.git)
cd mimick
flatpak-builder --user --install --force-clean build-dir io.github.nicx17.mimick.local.yml
flatpak run io.github.nicx17.mimick

```
