# Immich Auto-Sync User Guide

Welcome to Immich Auto-Sync for Linux! This guide provides detailed instructions on how to use the application to automatically back up your local photo and video directories to your Immich server.

---

## 1. Getting Started

### The System Tray Icon

Once the application is running, a blue "Immich" icon will appear in your system tray (usually at the top right on GNOME/KDE, or bottom right on other desktop environments).
*If you are using GNOME and don't see system tray icons, ensure you have the "AppIndicator and KStatusNotifierItem Support" extension enabled.*

Clicking on the tray icon reveals a menu with two primary options:

* **Settings**: Opens the configuration and status window.
* **Quit**: Safely shuts down the application and stops all background syncing.

## 2. Configuring the Application

### Accessing Settings

If you didn't configure the application on the first run, right-click the tray icon and select **Settings**.

### Connectivity & Server Details

1. **Internal URL (LAN)**: Enter the local IP address of your Immich server if it sits on the same network as your desktop (e.g., `http://192.168.1.10:2283`). This allows for high-speed local transfers when you are at home. You can toggle this connection mode on or off.
2. **External URL (WAN)**: Enter the public address of your server if you expose it to the internet (e.g., `https://immich.yourdomain.com`). The application will fall back to this address if you take your laptop on the road. You can toggle this connection mode on or off using the sliding switch. Must have at least one URL toggled on.
3. **API Key**:
    * Open your Immich Web Interface in a browser.
    * Go to **Account Settings** (profile icon in the top right) -> **API Keys**.
    * Click **New API Key**, give it a name (like "Linux Desktop"), and click Create.
    * Copy the long string of text and paste it into the application's API Key field.
    * *Note: This key is never stored in plain text. It is saved in your system's secure keyring.*

**Test Connection**: Click this button to verify that the app can successfully reach your server. The test uses a wait cursor to prevent UI stalling during network exploration, explicitly verifying the valid `{"res": "pong"}` JSON payload to guarantee you are speaking to the true Immich server rather than a captive router portal. The popup will tell you exactly which toggle (Internal vs External) it successfully locked onto.

### Choosing Folders to Watch

1. Under **Watch Folders**, click **+ Add Folder**.
2. Select a local directory (e.g., `~/Pictures`, `~/Videos/Exports`).
3. The application will monitor these folders recursively (including all sub-folders).
4. *Smart Album Selection*: By default, if you drop files into `~/Pictures/Vacation`, the app will automatically create an album in Immich named "Vacation". You can also map specific watch folders directly to existing Immich albums by selecting them from the dropdown menu, or type a custom new album name to be created automatically.

## 3. How Syncing Works

### Automatic Detection

Once configured, the application runs silently in the background. When you add a new photo to one of your watched folders, `immich-sync` detects it instantly via Linux filesystem events (`inotify`).

* It waits a moment to ensure the file has finished downloading or rendering.
* It calculates a checksum of the photo.
* It uploads it to your Immich server in the background.

### Sync Status

You can check to see what the application is currently doing by opening the **Settings** window.
The "Sync Status" section features a progress bar and label indicating:

* **Status: Idle**: Nothing is currently uploading. It will show the total number of files processed.
* **Uploading**: Will list the specific filename being transferred and show a dynamic progress bar tracking the batch.

### Notifications

As files are uploaded, you may see a native desktop notification appear on your screen showing the upload progress.

## 4. Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Will this delete my local files?**
No. This is strictly a "One-Way Sync" (Backup mode). It reads your local files and uploads them. It will *never* delete a file on your local machine, and it will *never* download files deleted from the Immich web interface back to your computer.

**Q: Are sidecar files supported?**
Currently, `immich-sync` intentionally ignores metadata sidecar files (like `.xmp`). Immich has limited backend support for sidecars uploaded via the standard API without bulk CLI tools, so we filter them to prevent clutter.

**Q: What happens if my server is offline?**
The application will detect the connection failure. Right now, it relies on connection retries. Advanced offline queuing is currently on the development roadmap.
