# Architecture Overview

This document describes the high-level architecture of `immich-sync`, a Linux desktop daemon for syncing media to Immich.

## System Components

The application is designed as a multi-threaded daemon with a decoupled UI process.

### 1. Core Daemon (`src/main.py`)

The entry point of the application. It performs environment setup (setting `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP="Unity"` to enforce AppIndicators via `pystray`, and forcing X11 backend for GDK (`GDK_BACKEND="x11"`) to avoid Wayland issues with legacy tray icons) and initializes the `Monitor` and `TrayIcon`.

### 2. File Monitor (`src/monitor.py`)

Uses the `watchdog` library to listen for filesystem events (`IN_CREATE`, `IN_MOVED_TO`).

- **Event Handling**: Filters events to allow only specific media extensions (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.mp4`, etc.).
- **Debouncing**: Implements a `wait_for_file_completion` check to ensure files are fully written to disk before processing.
- **Checksum**: Calculates SHA-1 checksums immediately to support Immich's deduplication logic.

### 3. Queue Manager (`src/queue_manager.py`)

A thread-safe orchestrator for upload tasks.

- **Upload Queue**: A FIFO queue receiving file tasks from the Monitor.
- **Retry Queue**: Captures failed uploads and safely persists them via `~/.cache/immich-sync/retries.json` to guarantee offline restorations across soft reboots.
- **Worker Pool**: Spawns 10 daemon threads to process uploads in parallel, coupled with a `Retry-Worker` repeating every 60 seconds.
- **Progress Tracking**: updates the `StateManager` with current progress.

### 4. API Client (`src/api_client.py`)

Encapsulates communication with the Immich Server.

- **Dual-URL Support**: Checks logical connectivity to Internal (LAN) URL first, falling back to External (WAN) URL depending on toggle switch states in the local Config. Includes captive portal verification checks.
- **Failover State Reset**: Automatically clears active TCP URL caches on request timeouts so the LAN vs WAN exploration triggers accurately immediately after connection drops.
- **Asset Upload**: Handles `multipart/form-data` uploads.
- **Album Management**: Uploads are mapped to a configured `album_id`, a custom `album_name`, or dynamically matches the immediate parent folder name. The system queries the `ApiClient` to resolve or create the missing album dynamically over REST. Features robust internal routing with `threading.Lock()` to prevent race conditions from generating duplicate album records under simultaneous heavy worker loads.

### 5. Settings UI (`src/settings_window.py`)

A standalone `PySide6` (Qt) application that runs firmly in a separate process from the daemon.

- **Reasoning**: Mixing GTK (used by `pystray`/`AppIndicator`) and Qt event loops in the same process causes instability and crashes.
- **Communication**: Reads status from `~/.cache/immich-sync/status.json` to display the progress bar.

### 6. Notifications & State

- **Notifications**: Uses `notify-send` via `subprocess` to display native desktop notifications with progress bars.
- **State Manager**: Serializes the daemon's current activity (queue size, current file) to a JSON file for the UI to consume.
